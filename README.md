# Body_Type_Prediction

As human, we are all attracted to people’s look. And people have strong preferences on body type. Therefore, we are interested to see how body type is displayed in the dataset and its relationship with other variables. Besides, we also want to predict body type using the other variables, for example, diet, drinks, etc..

The dataset contains user profiles from the dating site [OkCupid.com](okcupid.com). The users are all based in San Francisco, California beginning in June 2012. The columns include demographics and user answers and they are used for others to see on their profile page. The original source is [“OkCupid Data for Introductory Statistics and Data Science Courses”](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10691898.2015.11889737#) by Albert Kim and Adriana Escobedo-Land.
